#  The most basic map config can be just this one file, but when

[ Map ]

# The map title is quoted for best results. The quotes are not drawn.
Title = "Hello, World."

# The map scales position coordinates to image pixels.
# A scale of 1 maps each position step to a pixel, where a scale of 10
# maps each step to 10 pixels. This means your image will be
# x10 as wide, but reasonably so to fit words and extra
# images on the map.
Scale = 2

# The background color of the map in web hex format.
Backcolor = "#7d7966"

# The legend allows you to include a reference card of what the
# icons on your map represent. If the legend section is present,
# then it will print in a widened border of your map.
