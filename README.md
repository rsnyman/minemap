# MineMap

Minemap is a tool that generates an top-down aerial map from values fed in through a config file. This tool started as a way to map out minetest worlds by recording notable positions and giving them clever names.

# Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Python PIL

# Using MineMap

    python minemap.py --map-file [path to json configuration]

The map is saved in the same location as the config.
